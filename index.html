    <h3>About</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I'm Aric, a digital storyteller, data journalist and inherent creator of copy and code.</p>
      <br />
      <p>My most recent gig was with the Associated Press in Indiana as a legislative relief reporter writing stories with both state and national scope. For nearly 5 months, I skulked around the Statehouse cornering politicians and tracking daily legislative actions for the wire. I also got a chance to cover the state primaries and presidential elections and investigated shady campaign contributions to the state's governor's race.</p>
      <br />
      <p>In my experience so far, I've had a chance to wear a few hats in digital communication building web interfaces, copy editing, news editing, beat and graphic reporting and social media strategy.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I've spent the previous few years melding reporting with web development to help my storytelling process through writing web scrapers in Python, manipulating data for analysis on a command line and visualizing intangible datasets.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I spend a lot of time reading about investigative journalism, UX design and front-end methodologies. I usually tweet a lot of the ideas and stories I come across, so <a href="http://twitter.com/@aric_chokey" target="blank">connect with me on Twitter</a> and see which ideas I'm tossing around.</p>
